###My Bomberman Project
This is a Bomberman-inspired game developed as part of my final course project. It draws inspiration from the open-source Bomberman clone by Forestf90 with extensive enhancements to the AI, audio, and gameplay experience.

###About
This project is a Bomberman-style game where players navigate a maze, plant bombs, and face off against intelligent AI opponents. It incorporates six newly designed AI algorithms and background music to enrich the gameplay, building upon the original interface design.
